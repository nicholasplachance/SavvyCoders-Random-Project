# Nick LaChance
## A SavvyCoders student

Here is a list of the different programming languages I know:
1. Python
2. HTML
3. CSS
4. JavaScript

I have been teaching myself programming for the past two years before I decided to apply for SavvyCoders. I started my journey with Python and creating simple scripts. Now I am learing Web Development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
